---

## Acceptance Criteria Template (use per story)
- Given [context], when [action], then [observable outcome].

- Accessibility threshold (WCAG AA acceptance where interactive).
- Privacy statement: what data is stored, for how long, and how to delete.

---

## Example Detailed Story (format for implementation)
- ID: L1
- Title: Beginner Guides for Personal Security
- Persona: Concerned Citizen
- Story: As a Concerned Citizen, I want step-by-step guides (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) for securing my devices and accounts, so I can follow concrete steps to improve my security.
- Acceptance:
  - Given I land on the Personal Security guide landing page, when I select "Beginner", then I see a checklist of 10 clear steps with estimated times and a printable PDF.
  - Each step has safe defaults and a "Why this matters" short note.
  - All content includes last-reviewed date and author.
- Priority: High
- Effort: 5
- Edge cases: user on low-bandwidth, offline printable view, translations, no-JS fallback for core content.

---

## Edge Cases & Risks (top 8)
1. Users in crisis need offline/printable emergency guidance — ensure printable PDFs and concise steps.
2. Tools that accept URLs or inputs must not leak sensitive user data to third parties — prefer client-side checks or sanitize & document flows.
3. Legal/regulatory differences across jurisdictions for breach notifications — make templates advisory and recommend local counsel.
4. Accessibility gaps — prioritize core flows and emergency pages for WCAG compliance.
5. Misuse of tools (fingerprinting or scan abuse) — rate-limit and throttle APIs.
6. Translation quality and stale translations — flag translations with verification dates.
7. Fake trust signals or misuse of endorsements — ensure partner logos/endorsements have explicit permissions.
8. Privacy/Telemetry opt-out must persist across sessions and respect Do Not Track where feasible.

---

## Quick Contract (core features)
- Inputs: user-selected guide level or tool input (non-sensitive by default), optionally user account data if logged in.
- Outputs: human-readable steps, downloadable PDFs, tool results with recommended next steps.
- Error modes: validation errors, low-confidence results, network failures — always show clear recovery steps.
- Success criteria: users can complete a recommended security step and confirm a measurable outcome (e.g., enable 2FA).

---

## Next Steps (recommended)
- Convert high-priority stories into backlog items with tasks (design, content, frontend, backend, QA).
- Draft wireframes for: homepage, guide article, emergency flow, tool UI, CMS editor.
- Create minimal MVP: homepage + 3 beginner guides + emergency page + one client-side tool + CMS seed.
- Plan 2-week sprint to implement MVP features with tests and accessibility checks.

---

If you want, I can:
- Export these stories into a formatted file (Markdown or CSV) and add them to the repo as `safenet-userstories.md`.
- Convert high-priority stories into GitHub issues (you'll need to provide access).
- Draft wireframe mockups (textual or simple HTML prototypes) for the homepage and emergency flow.

Which of those would you like me to do next?

SVeena25: can you create userstories using acceptance criteria and tasks

GitHub Copilot: I'm going to (1) mark the user-stories generation step done and move the review step to in-progress in the todo list, and (2) create a Markdown file `safenet-userstories.md` in your project with detailed user stories that include acceptance criteria and implementation tasks; expected outcome: the repo will contain the new file and the todo list updated. I'll run both updates now.

SVeena25: Can you generate userstories for Safenet: Designing a Digitally Protected World website with acceptance criteria and tasks. Group them in to must-have, should-have and could-have priority please

GitHub Copilot: I'm updating the todo list to mark "Generate user stories" done and set "Review and refine stories" in-progress so we track progress; outcome: todo list reflects current state.

Starting (2/3) *Review and refine stories*

Progress update: todo list updated (generation completed, review in-progress). Below are the user stories grouped by priority (Must-have / Should-have / Could-have). Each story includes acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then where applicable) and an implementation task breakdown (Design / Content / Frontend / Backend / QA). If you want, I can export this to `safenet-userstories.md` in the repo — say the word and I’ll add the file.
